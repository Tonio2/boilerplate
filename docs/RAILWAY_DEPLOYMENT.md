## Prerequisites

- ✅ Git repository on GitHub
- ✅ Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- ✅ All code changes from Railway setup committed

---

## Local Testing (Before Railway)

**IMPORTANT:** Always test your production build locally before deploying to Railway!

### Step 1: Build Everything

```bash
# From project root
npm run build

# This will:
# 1. Install client dependencies
# 2. Install server dependencies
# 3. Build React app (client/dist)
# 4. Compile TypeScript (server/dist)
```

### Step 2: Set Up Local Environment

```bash
# Make sure Docker Compose is running (for PostgreSQL)
docker-compose up -d

# Set production environment variables
export NODE_ENV=production
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/boilerplate
export JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=test_secret_xxx
export JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=test_secret_yyy
export JWT_EMAIL_SECRET=test_secret_zzz
export GMAIL_USER=test@gmail.com
export GMAIL_PWD=test_password
export CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5000
export PORT=5000
```

### Step 3: Run Production Server

```bash
# From project root
npm start

# Server should start on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Open your browser and test:

- ✅ http://localhost:5000 - React app loads
- ✅ http://localhost:5000/health - Returns `{"status":"healthy"}`
- ✅ Static files load (check Network tab for JS/CSS)
- ✅ API endpoints work
- ✅ No console errors

**If local testing fails, DO NOT deploy to Railway yet!** Fix issues locally first.

## Initial Railway Setup

### Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended)
4. Verify your email
5. You'll receive $5 in trial credits

### Step 2: Create New Project

1. Click "New Project" in Railway dashboard
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
4. Select your boilerplate repository
5. Railway will start building automatically

**Initial build might fail** - that's expected! We haven't set up environment variables yet.

### Step 3: Watch Build Logs

1. Click on your service in Railway dashboard
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the active deployment
4. Watch the logs to see what's happening

**Common first-time issues:**
- ❌ Missing environment variables (expected)
- ❌ Database connection failed (expected)
- ⚠️ Build succeeded but app crashes (need env vars)

---

## Database Configuration

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database"
3. Select "PostgreSQL"
4. Wait ~1 minute for provisioning

### Step 2: Verify DATABASE_URL

1. Click on the PostgreSQL service
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. You'll see `DATABASE_URL` is automatically created
4. This variable is automatically shared with your app service

**You don't need to copy/paste DATABASE_URL!** Railway handles this automatically.

---

## Environment Variables

### Step 1: Generate Secure Secrets

**CRITICAL:** Don't use the example secrets in production!

Generate new secrets on your local machine:

```bash
# Generate JWT secrets
openssl rand -base64 32  # Use for JWT_ACCESS_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32  # Use for JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32  # Use for JWT_EMAIL_SECRET
```

### Step 2: Set Up Gmail App Password

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Create a new app password named "Railway App"
3. Copy the generated 16-character password
4. Use this as `GMAIL_PWD` (NOT your regular Gmail password)

### Step 3: Add Variables in Railway Dashboard

1. Click on your app service (not the database)
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Click "New Variable"
4. Add each variable one by one:

```bash
# Required Variables
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<paste generated secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<paste generated secret>
JWT_EMAIL_SECRET=<paste generated secret>
GMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PWD=<paste Gmail app password>
CLIENT_URL=${{ RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN }}
```

**Note:** `${{ RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN }}` is a Railway template variable that auto-fills with your app's URL.

### Step 4: Trigger Redeploy

After adding all variables:

1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Or just push a new commit to trigger deployment

---

## Database Migrations

After your app deploys successfully, you need to run database migrations.

### Option 1: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
cd /path/to/your/project
railway link
# Select your project from the list

# Run migrations
railway run npm run db:migrate --prefix server

# Or if using Drizzle push:
railway run npm run db:push --prefix server
```

### Option 2: Using Railway Dashboard

1. Go to your project in Railway dashboard
2. Click on your app service
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Scroll to "Deploy Lifecycle"
5. Under "Start Command", temporarily change to:
   ```
   cd server && npm run db:migrate && node dist/index.js
   ```
6. Redeploy
7. After first successful deploy, change back to:
   ```
   cd server && node dist/index.js
   ```

**Warning:** Option 2 runs migrations on every deploy, which can be risky. Use Option 1 for production.

### Verify Migrations

Check the deployment logs to confirm migrations ran:

```
✅ Migrations completed successfully
✅ Server started on port XXXX
```

---

## Testing Your Deployment

### Step 1: Get Your Railway URL

1. In Railway dashboard, click on your app service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Look for "Domains" section
4. You'll see something like: `your-app-production.up.railway.app`
5. Copy this URL

### Step 2: Test the Deployment

Open your Railway URL in a browser:

**Basic Tests:**
- ✅ https://your-app.railway.app - React app loads
- ✅ https://your-app.railway.app/health - Health check returns OK
- ✅ No console errors (F12 → Console)
- ✅ Static files load (F12 → Network tab)

**Feature Tests:**
- ✅ Register a new user
- ✅ Login works
- ✅ JWT tokens are issued
- ✅ Protected routes work
- ✅ Email verification (if applicable)

### Step 3: Monitor Logs

Keep the deployment logs open to watch for errors:

1. Railway dashboard → Your service → "Deployments"
2. Click on active deployment
3. Watch real-time logs

**Look for:**
- ✅ "Server running on port XXXX"
- ✅ "Database connected"
- ❌ Any error messages
- ⚠️ Warning messages

---

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### Step 1: Generate Railway Domain

1. Railway dashboard → Your service → "Settings"
2. Scroll to "Domains"
3. Click "Generate Domain"
4. You'll get a better subdomain like: `your-app.up.railway.app`

### Step 2: Add Custom Domain

1. In "Domains" section, click "Custom Domain"
2. Enter your domain: `yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com`
3. Railway will show DNS records to add

### Step 3: Configure DNS

1. Go to your domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Add the CNAME record Railway provides:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: app (or @ for root domain)
   Value: <provided by Railway>
   TTL: 3600
   ```
3. Save changes

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation

- DNS propagation takes 5 minutes to 48 hours (usually ~1 hour)
- Railway auto-provisions SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt
- Once propagated, your site will be accessible at your custom domain

### Step 5: Update CLIENT_URL

1. Go back to Railway dashboard
2. Update the `CLIENT_URL` variable to your custom domain:
   ```
   CLIENT_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```
3. Redeploy

## Staging + Production Workflow

For serious projects, set up separate environments for testing before production.

### Step 1: Create Staging Branch

```bash
git checkout -b staging
git push origin staging
```

### Step 2: Create Staging Environment in Railway

1. In your Railway project, click "New Environment"
2. Name it "staging"
3. Go to environment settings
4. Change the branch to "staging"
5. Add a new PostgreSQL database for staging
6. Set environment variables (use different JWT secrets!)
7. Update `CLIENT_URL` to staging domain

### Step 3: Development Workflow

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/new-thing
# ... make changes ...
git commit -am "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-thing

# Create PR to staging
# Railway auto-creates preview environment

# Merge to staging
git checkout staging
git merge feature/new-thing
git push origin staging
# → Railway deploys to staging automatically

# Test on staging for a day

# Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main
# → Railway deploys to production automatically
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Error: "Cannot find module 'xyz'"**

Solution:
```bash
# Make sure package.json exists in both client/ and server/
# Verify dependencies are listed correctly
cd client && npm ci
cd ../server && npm ci
```

**Error: "TypeScript compilation failed"**

Solution:
```bash
# Check tsconfig.json is correct
# Verify all TypeScript files compile locally
cd server && npm run build
```

### Deployment Succeeds But App Crashes

**Error: "Application failed to respond"**

Check logs for:
```
❌ DATABASE_URL not set
❌ JWT_ACCESS_SECRET not set
❌ Port binding error
```

Solution:
1. Verify all environment variables are set
2. Check health check endpoint exists: `/health`
3. Ensure server binds to `process.env.PORT` (Railway provides this)

### Static Files Not Loading

**Error: 404 on JS/CSS files**

Solution:
1. Verify `client/dist` folder exists after build
2. Check static file path in `server/src/index.ts` (see server-index-changes.ts)
3. Make sure production mode is enabled: `NODE_ENV=production`

### Database Connection Fails

**Error: "Connection refused" or "timeout"**

Solution:
1. Verify PostgreSQL addon is running
2. Check DATABASE_URL is set (Railway does this automatically)
3. Run migrations: `railway run npm run db:migrate --prefix server`

### CORS Errors

**Error: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"**

Solution:
1. Check `CLIENT_URL` matches your Railway domain
2. Update CORS configuration in server to allow Railway domain
3. For monolith (serving React from Express), you shouldn't have CORS issues

### Health Check Failing

**Error: "Health check timeout"**

Solution:
1. Verify `/health` endpoint exists and responds quickly
2. Check server is binding to correct port: `process.env.PORT`
3. Ensure health check doesn't require authentication
